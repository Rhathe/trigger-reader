We at trigger.io have developed a little example project with a CSS reset, Backbone and a couple of pages with transitions.

Features
 - Backbone.js
 - CSS reset
 - RSS feed parsing
 - Transitions

Please feel free to base your own projects on this - it's a great springboard for a new project. The tutorial that references this code is here: http://docs.trigger.io/en/latest/best_practice/example_project.html
